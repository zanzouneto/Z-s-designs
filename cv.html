            <p>I opened a laser cut / laser engraving workshop in Kyiv, the aim of which was to make custom on-of-a-kind items. 
                Before I opened the workshop I handled the construction in the site which was a challenge of its own. 
                It was a solo mission, I was doing everything myself. It was a very experimental and educational project. While it didn’t reach a very profitable stage, I still had to get to better understand marketing, sales, social media.. and everything that was outside of the scope of what I was focused on before.

                <br>I was also part of the team working on developing an <a target="_blank" href="https://lift99-hr.webflow.io/"> HR platform</a> to match startups with talents, my role included web design, web implementation, user experience… 
                <br>I was working at LIFT99 when Russia invaded Ukraine, it was at that time when we shifted our focus to make sure members of our community were safe. Quickly after we launched multiple projects to help Ukrainians, the Ukrainian army, and projects to support small businesses, entrepreneurs & founders of Ukraine. All under the banner of Helpp99.
